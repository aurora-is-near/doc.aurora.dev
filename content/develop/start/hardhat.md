# Getting Started with Hardhat

## Introduction

[HardHat](https://hardhat.org/) is yet another Ethereum development environment.
It is known for debugging the Solidity code and the explicit error messages.
Moreover it has extra nice features such as the interactive JavaScript console
and the user defined tasks.

The main objective of this tutorial is to show how to deploy and interact with
the Solidity smart contracts on Aurora using HardHat. This tutorial assumes that
you are familiar with `HardHat` and the ERC-20 tokens. For more details about
the fungible token standard, please refer to
the [ERC-20 Standard specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20).

## Installation

This tutorial assumes that you have Node.js 12+ and Yarn. Please refer to
the [Yarn installation how-to](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable)
if you don't yet have the yarn command installed locally.

- To install the prerequisite packages, clone the examples repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-examples.git
cd aurora-examples/hardhat/erc20/
```

- Add your Aurora Private key (from MetaMask) to __.env__ file and
then run yarn : <br/>

```bash
echo "AURORA_PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_AURORA_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE" >> .env
yarn install
```

## Deploy ERC-20

The ERC-20 example is about a naive Watermelon token 🍉. You can exchange
them into actual Watermelons 🍉🍉🍉. The total supply is `1000000`, the
minter is the contract deployer address, and the decimals are `0`
(One token --> One watermelon).

To deploy the `ERC-20` token contract, use the following command:

```bash
$ make deploy NETWORK=testnet_aurora
yarn hardat run scripts/deploy.js --network testnet_aurora
yarn run v1.22.10
Deploying contracts with the account: 0x6A33382de9f73B846878a57500d055B981229ac4
Account balance: 2210010200000000000
WatermelonToken deployed to: 0xD7f2A76F5DA173043E6c61a0A18D835809A07766
✨  Done in 14.96s.

# export the token address
$ export TOKEN_ADDRESS='YOUR OUTPUT FROM DEPLOY (e.g. 0xD7f2A76F5DA173043E6c61a0A18D835809A07766)'
```

## HardHat Tasks

HardHat tasks take care of parsing the values provided for each parameter.
It gets the values, performs the type validation and converts them into your desired type.

In this example, we will go through a set of pre-defined HardHat tasks
that uses the HardHat Runtime Environment ([HRE](https://hardhat.org/advanced/hardhat-runtime-environment.html)). In order to complete the tutorial,
you should use them in the same order:

### ETH Balance

The following HardHat task uses the `Web3` plugin to get the account’s balance:

```javascript
task("balance", "Prints an account's balance")
  .addParam("account", "The account's address")
  .setAction(async taskArgs => {
    const account = web3.utils.toChecksumAddress(taskArgs.account);
    const balance = await web3.eth.getBalance(account);

    console.log(web3.utils.fromWei(balance, "ether"), "ETH");
  });
```

To get the `ETH` balance, use the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat balance --network testnet_aurora --account 0x6A33382de9f73B846878a57500d055B981229ac4
2.2100102 ETH
```

You should notice that `--network` is a global built-in option (parameter)
in HardHat. We will use it for the following commands as well.

### Total Supply

The following task script gets the total supply of the Watermelon ERC-20 token.
First it attachs the
token contract, gets the sender address and finaly retrieves the total supply
by calling `totalSupply()` method in our ERC-20 contract. The `--token`
address is the ERC-20 contract address.

```javascript
task("totalSupply", "Total supply of ERC-20 token")
.addParam("token", "Token address")
.setAction(async function ({ token }, { ethers: { getSigners } }, runSuper) {
  const watermelonToken = await ethers.getContractFactory("WatermelonToken")
  const watermelon = watermelonToken.attach(token)
  const [minter] = await ethers.getSigners();
  const totalSupply = (await (await watermelon.connect(minter)).totalSupply()).toNumber()
  console.log(`Total Supply is ${totalSupply}`);
});
```

To get the `totalSupply`, use the following command:

```bash
$ npx hardhat totalSupply --token $TOKEN_ADDRESS --network testnet_aurora
Total Supply is 1000000
```

### Transfer ERC-20

The `transfer` option allows anyone holding an ERC-20 tokens to transfer
them to any Ethereum address. In the following script, the minter address
will mint (implicitly) and transfer `10 WTM` tokens to the `spender` address:

```javascript
task("transfer", "ERC-20 transfer")
    .addParam("token", "Token address")
    .addParam("spender", "Spender address")
    .addParam("amount", "Token amount")
    .setAction(async function ({ token, spender, amount }, { ethers: { getSigners } }, runSuper) {
        const watermelonToken = await ethers.getContractFactory("WatermelonToken")
        const watermelon = watermelonToken.attach(token)
        const [minter] = await ethers.getSigners();
        await (await watermelon.connect(minter).transfer(spender, amount)).wait()
        console.log(`${minter.address} has transferred ${amount} to ${spender}`);
    });
```

To call `transfer`, use the following command:

```bash
$ npx hardhat transfer --token $TOKEN_ADDRESS --amount 10 --spender 0x2531a4D108619a20ACeE88C4354a50e9aC48ecfe --network testnet_aurora
0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266 has transferred 10 tokens to 0x2531a4D108619a20ACeE88C4354a50e9aC48ecfe
```

### BalanceOf ERC-20

We can prove that the `spender` has received the exact amount of tokens
by calling the `balanceOf` as shown below:

```javascript
task("balanceOf", "Total supply of ERC-20 token")
.addParam("token", "Token address")
.addParam("account", "Account address")
.setAction(async function ({ token, account }, { ethers: { getSigners } }, runSuper) {
  const watermelonToken = await ethers.getContractFactory("WatermelonToken")
  const watermelon = watermelonToken.attach(token)
  const [minter] = await ethers.getSigners();
  const balance = (await (await watermelon.connect(minter)).balanceOf(account)).toNumber()
  console.log(`Account ${account} has a total token balance:  ${balance} WTM`);
});
```

To get the `balance`, use the following command:

```bash
$ npx hardhat balanceOf --token $TOKEN_ADDRESS --account 0x6A33382de9f73B846878a57500d055B981229ac4 --network testnet_aurora
Account 0x6A33382de9f73B846878a57500d055B981229ac4 has a total token balance:  999970 WTM
```

### Approve ERC-20

In some cases, instead of calling the `transfer` directly, the sender
can approve a specific amount of tokens to be withdrawn from his account
to specific receipient address later. This can be done by calling `approve`
then calling `transferFrom`.

```javascript
task("approve", "ERC-20 approve")
    .addParam("token", "Token address")
    .addParam("spender", "Spender address")
    .addParam("amount", "Token amount")
    .setAction(async function ({ token, spender, amount }, { ethers: { getSigners } }, runSuper) {
        const watermelonToken = await ethers.getContractFactory("WatermelonToken")
        const watermelon = watermelonToken.attach(token)
        const [sender] = await ethers.getSigners();
        await (await watermelon.connect(sender).approve(spender, amount)).wait()
        console.log(`${sender.address} has approved ${amount} tokens to ${spender}`);
    });

module.exports = {};
```

To call `approve`, use the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat approve --token $TOKEN_ADDRESS --spender 0x8722C88e82AbCC639148Ab6128Cd63333B2Ad771 --amount 10 --network testnet_aurora
0x6A33382de9f73B846878a57500d055B981229ac4 has approved 10 tokens to 0x8722C88e82AbCC639148Ab6128Cd63333B2Ad771
```

### TransferFrom ERC-20

After approving the tokens, a receipient can call `transferFrom` to move
the `allowance` to his account.  

```javascript
task("transferFrom", "ERC-20 transferFrom")
    .addParam("token", "Token address")
    .addParam("sender", "Sender address")
    .addParam("amount", "Token amount")
    .setAction(async function ({ token, sender, amount }, { ethers: { getSigners } }, runSuper) {
        const watermelonToken = await ethers.getContractFactory("WatermelonToken")
        const watermelon = watermelonToken.attach(token)
        const [recipient] = await ethers.getSigners()
        console.log(recipient.address);
        await (await watermelon.connect(recipient).transferFrom(sender, recipient.address, amount)).wait()
        console.log(`${recipient.address} has received ${amount} tokens from ${sender}`)
    });
```

To call `transferFrom`, use the following command:

```bash
# export the recipient private key
AURORA_PRIVATE_KEY="THE RECIPIENT PRIVATE KEY" npx hardhat transferFrom --token $TOKEN_ADDRESS --sender 0x6A33382de9f73B846878a57500d055B981229ac4  --amount 10 --network testnet_aurora
0x8722C88e82AbCC639148Ab6128Cd63333B2Ad771 has received 10 tokens from 0x6A33382de9f73B846878a57500d055B981229ac4
```

Checking the balance of `0x8722C88e82AbCC639148Ab6128Cd63333B2Ad771`:

```bash
npx hardhat balanceOf --token $TOKEN_ADDRESS --account 0x8722C88e82AbCC639148Ab6128Cd63333B2Ad771  --network testnet_aurora
Account 0x8722C88e82AbCC639148Ab6128Cd63333B2Ad771 has a total token balance:  10 WTM
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial we deployed an ERC-20 token using HardHat on the Aurora
TestNet, transferred, and approved ERC-20 tokens. Moreover, we added other
utility tasks such as getting the total supply, and the account balance.
The only difference is we changed the Ethereum MainNet to the Aurora
RPC endpoint.
