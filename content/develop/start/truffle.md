# Deploying a Contract Using Truffle

## Introduction

[Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) is a widely used development
environment and testing framework for Ethereum smart contracts. In this
tutorial, we will show by example how to use Truffle with the Aurora TestNet.

This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with Truffle and the non-fungible
tokens (NFT) concept. For more details about the non-fungible token standard,
please refer to the [ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token
Standard](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/)
specification.

## NFT Example

This example is originally forked from the [OpenZeppelin
examples](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc721). However, the code
has been changed to fit the use case of this tutorial. The use case is about how
to deploy and manage the life cycle of a simple COVID-19 vaccine NFT token ðŸ’ŠðŸ’Š
using Truffle on the Aurora TestNet.

![Truffle NFT example](../../_img/truffle_nft_example.png)

1. The minter address (which is managed by the vaccination program manager) can
distribute (mint) the vaccine tickets (NFT tokens ðŸ’ŠðŸ’ŠðŸ’Š) to the people who are
part of the vaccination program.

2. When participants receive the tokens ðŸ’Š, they can get access to the vaccine
by spending the NFT token.

3. This means either burning the NFT token or sending it back to the minter
address.

4. If the participant chooses to send it back then the minter can redistribute
that token ðŸŽ« to another participant in the line.

5. Then the new participant will have access to the same vaccine token that has
been used by the previous participant.

## Installing Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you have Node.js 12+ and Yarn. Please refer to the
[Yarn installation how-to](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) if you
don't yet have the `yarn` command installed locally.

To install the prerequisite packages, clone the examples repository and then run
`yarn`:

### Install Truffle

```bash
npm install -g truffle 
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-examples.git

cd aurora-examples/truffle/erc721-example/

yarn 
```

## Connecting Truffle to Aurora

Export your `MNEMONIC` as follows:

```bash
export MNEMONIC='YOUR MNEMONIC HERE'
```

Now in `truffle-config.js`, you will need to change the `from` address as shown
below in the `aurora` network section:

```json
...
aurora: {
  provider: () => setupWallet('https://testnet.aurora.dev'),
  network_id: 0x4e454153,
  gas: 10000000,
  from: '0x6A33382de9f73B846878a57500d055B981229ac4' // CHANGE THIS ADDRESS
},
```

The `truffle-config.js` configuration will pick up your `MNEMONIC` environmen
variable and recover the address that will be used for sending and signing
transactions on the Aurora network.

## Deploying the Contract

To deploy the `CovidVaccineToken` contract, you can run the `yarn` command as
follows:

```bash
yarn deploy:aurora
....
_deploy_contracts.js
=====================

   > total cost:          0.05152548 ETH
....
```

## Playing with the Truffle Console

Now you can test the flow as mentioned in the [NFT Example](#nft-example)
section:

### Mint tokens

The minter mints and transfers NFT tokens for the vaccine program participant.
In this example, the new participant address is
`0x2531a4D108619a20ACeE88C4354a50e9aC48ecfe` and the minter address is
`0x6A33382de9f73B846878a57500d055B981229ac4`.

Please make sure that you are using the same deployer address as a minter
address, otherwise the `mint` transaction will revert.

```bash
% truffle console --network aurora
truffle(aurora)> const cvt = await CovidVaccineToken.deployed()
truffle(aurora)> await cvt.minter()
'0x6A33382de9f73B846878a57500d055B981229ac4'
truffle(aurora)> await cvt.mint('0x2531a4D108619a20ACeE88C4354a50e9aC48ecfe' , {from: accounts[0]})
```

You should notice that `accounts[0]` is the minter address and none of the
participants are allowed to transfer their NFT tokens except for the minter.

So let's try to use any participant address to validate this. To do that, change
the value of `from` to `accounts[1]`, so that the sender will be the first
participant (e.g., the participant address
`0x2531a4D108619a20ACeE88C4354a50e9aC48ecfe`).

In the Truffle console:

```bash
truffle(aurora)> await cvt.safeTransferFrom('0x2531a4d108619a20acee88c4354a50e9ac48ecfe', '0x8722C88e82AbCC639148Ab6128Cd63333B2Ad771', 1, {from: accounts[1]}) 
Uncaught Error: execution reverted:
...
reason: 'Invalid Transfer',
  hijackedStack: 'Error: execution reverted:\n'
```

This is exactly the same error message we have in our NFT contract in
`safeTransferFrom`:

```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(
    address from, 
    address to, 
    uint256 tokenId
) 
    public 
    virtual 
    override 
    {
        require(
            minter == msg.sender || to == minter,
            'Invalid Transfer'
        );
        safeTransferFrom(from, to, tokenId, "");
    }
```

### Transfer tokens

Participants can transfer the token to the minter after receiving the vaccine.
As shown below, a participant can only send the NFT token if the receiver for
this token is the minter (`0x6A33382de9f73B846878a57500d055B981229ac4`).

```bash
truffle(aurora)> await cvt.ownerOf(1) // TokenID 1
'0x2531a4D108619a20ACeE88C4354a50e9aC48ecfe'
truffle(aurora)> await cvt.minter()
'0x6A33382de9f73B846878a57500d055B981229ac4'
truffle(aurora)> await cvt.safeTransferFrom('0x2531a4D108619a20ACeE88C4354a50e9aC48ecfe', '0x6A33382de9f73B846878a57500d055B981229ac4', 1 , {from: accounts[1]})
truffle(aurora)> await cvt.ownerOf(1) // TokenID 1
'0x6A33382de9f73B846878a57500d055B981229ac4'
```

### Burn tokens

This is an alternative scenario for the NFT token lifecycle. Instead of
transfering the token back to the minter, the participant can decide to burn the
NFT token by calling the `burn` function:

```bash
truffle(aurora)> await cvt.burn(1, {from: accounts[1]}) // 1 is the tokenID
```

### Redistribute tokens

Finally, the minter can send the same token (if not burnt) to a new participant
in the line:

```bash
truffle(aurora)> await cvt.safeTransferFrom('0x6A33382de9f73B846878a57500d055B981229ac4','0x8722C88e82AbCC639148Ab6128Cd63333B2Ad771', 1 , {from: accounts[0]})
truffle(aurora)> await cvt.ownerOf(1)
'0x8722C88e82AbCC639148Ab6128Cd63333B2Ad771'
```

## Summary

In this simple tutorial, we deployed an NFT contract to the Aurora TestNet using
Truffle and interacted with the contract's functions.
