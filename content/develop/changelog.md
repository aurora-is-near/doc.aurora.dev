# Changelog

## 2021-06-04

## 2021-06-02

### All endpoints

- **Aurora Relayer**: Changed the `eth_estimateGas` RPC method's return value
  to 6,721,975, to match Truffle's default gas limit.
  ([d8c672c](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-relayer/commit/d8c672c249704dc6221a682bf62c101c78fbeb3a),
  [#16](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-relayer/issues/16))

- **Aurora Relayer**: Ensured that the `eth_sendRawTransaction` RPC method
  rejects transactions that have a gas limit lower than the minimum 21,000.
  ([87b96ed](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-relayer/commit/87b96ed7b2a50e68f426032079bbd1c0ed16bb9e),

- **Aurora Relayer**: Bumped the `eth_estimateGas` RPC method's return value
  from zero to 300,000, sufficient to cover most MetaMask transactions.
  ([6797a94](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-relayer/commit/6797a94a781cd239122b73724bb6f528a37a3772),

## 2021-05-24

### All endpoints

- **Aurora Relayer**: Fixed a bug in the `eth_call` RPC method. This had been
  affecting MetaMask users in particular.
  ([1d0d7cd](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-relayer/commit/1d0d7cd7f00da1f0d118e8a79cfc70362ed773f2))

## 2021-05-19

- We have rolled out [new endpoint URLs](/develop/networks.html). Changing
  from the former endpoint URL `https://rpc.$NETWORK.aurora.dev:8545` to
  `https://$NETWORK.aurora.dev` is recommended and will decrease your
  response latency and increase your rate limits.

## 2021-05-17

### All endpoints

- **Aurora Relayer**: Fixed a response encoding discrepancy with the
  `eth_getTransactionReceipt` RPC method which was causing Truffle to
  believe that the transaction reverted when deploying contracts.
  ([2500fd9](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-relayer/commit/2500fd9d805f361e2f871c4cd8791308ce8a3417))

## 2021-05-13

### All endpoints

- **Aurora Relayer**: Fixed a regression in the `eth_getTransactionReceipt`
  RPC method.
  ([07dc0da](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-relayer/commit/07dc0daf291160aa7c81d99a9573d1d1d3af6933))
- Fixed the [CORS preflight](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Preflight_request)
  response by ensuring that the response has status code 204 and contains
  the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` and `Access-Control-Allow-Methods:
  OPTIONS, POST` headers.

## 2021-05-12
