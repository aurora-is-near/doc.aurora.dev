title: "Aurora: The Graph"
---


## Introduction

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is an indexing service which collects
Ethereum events and exports them through GraphQL endpoints. It is widely
used in the Ethereum ecosystem which supports fast and cheap queries for
DApps.

This tutorial covers the following topics:

- Running a Graph node on Aurora.
- Creating and deploying a subgraph.
- Querying events from the subgraph.

## Prerequisites

Before delving into the tutorial, you need to make sure that you have setup
the following tools on you machine:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Node 12+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)

## Running Graph Node

### Clone

Clone the graph node source code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/
cd graph-node
```

### Configure

In order wire your local graph node with Aurora Testnet RPC, you should change
the value of `ethereum` section in `docker/docker-compose.yaml` file from
 `mainnet:http://host.docker.internal:8545` to
 `'aurora:https://testnet.aurora.dev'`.

```yaml
....
    environment:
      postgres_host: postgres
      postgres_user: graph-node
      postgres_pass: let-me-in
      postgres_db: graph-node
      ipfs: 'ipfs:5001'
      ethereum: 'aurora:https://testnet.aurora.dev'
      GRAPH_LOG: info
...
```

### Start

The following commands will setup the environment and start the graph indexer.
The indexing process might take long time to have 100% sync with the chain.
This has nothing to do with our tutorial but keep this process running in a
separate terminal.

```bash
cd graph-node/docker
./setup.sh
docker-compose up
```

## Create a subgraph

Now we are done with starting our graph node, the next step is to create and
deploy a subgraph. The subgraph defines how the data on Ethereum will be
indexed and stored on the graph node.

In this tutorial, we are going to use the subgraph example called
[GravatarRegistry](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/example-subgraph) (a simple
on-chain Gravatar). The GravatarRegistry contract has two events:

```javascript
event NewGravatar(uint id, address owner, string displayName, string imageUrl);
event UpdatedGravatar(uint id, address owner, string displayName, string imageUrl);
```

The contract was already deployed on Aurora Testnet. The deployed `GravatarRegistry`
contract address is `0x8773e6832f44b2C17AC78592ffCe407C62d8c36E` and the start
block number is `74885768`.

### Clone subgraph

Clone subgraph example repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aurora-is-near/example-subgraph.git
cd example-subgraph
```

### Install

```bash
yarn install
```

### Configure the Subgraph

Update the `address` and (the `startBlock` optional) in `subgraph.yaml` as follows:

```yaml
    ...
    network: aurora
    source:
      address: '0x8773e6832f44b2C17AC78592ffCe407C62d8c36E'
      abi: Gravity
      startBlock: 74885768
    ...
```

Also make sure you are pointing into `aurora` as a network.

### Generating types

```bash
yarn codegen 
  Skip migration: Bump mapping apiVersion from 0.0.1 to 0.0.2
  Skip migration: Bump mapping apiVersion from 0.0.2 to 0.0.3
  Skip migration: Bump mapping apiVersion from 0.0.3 to 0.0.4
  Skip migration: Bump mapping apiVersion from 0.0.4 to 0.0.5
  Skip migration: Bump mapping specVersion from 0.0.1 to 0.0.2

```

### Mappings

Maps Ethereum event data to the data that has been defined in the
`schema.graphql`. For example `handleNewGravatar` parses the new event
parameters, and save them in `gravatar`.

```javascript
export function handleNewGravatar(event: NewGravatar): void {
  let gravatar = new Gravatar(event.params.id.toHex())
  gravatar.owner = event.params.owner
  gravatar.displayName = event.params.displayName
  gravatar.imageUrl = event.params.imageUrl
  gravatar.save()
}
```

## Deploy the Subgraph

First, we need to register the subgraph name on the graph node. To do that
run `yarn create-local`.

```bash
$ yarn create-local              
Created subgraph: example
✨  Done in 2.12s.
```

Once the subgraph is registered, now you can deploy it by executing the
following command:

```bash
$ yarn deploy-local

Build completed: QmUiu7NRW7Lc89rxfacqUViaFLYwftrGUn54segMFgWggu

Deployed to http://127.0.0.1:8000/subgraphs/name/example/graphql

Subgraph endpoints:
Queries (HTTP):     http://127.0.0.1:8000/subgraphs/name/example
Subscriptions (WS): http://127.0.0.1:8001/subgraphs/name/example

✨  Done in 10.23s.
```

Now, you should be able to access your subgraph endpoint through `http://127.0.0.1:8000/subgraphs/name/example`.

## Publish Events (optional)

There were already published events starting from block number `74885768`,
So you can skip this step.

## Query Events

To query events, TheGraph protocol provides a [GraphQL endpoint](http://127.0.0.1:8000/subgraphs/name/example)
for your local graph node. Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/subgraphs/name/example`,
it automatically will show up a predefined GraphQL query. Run this query to
get the results as shown below:

## Summary

In this tutorial, we started a Graph node locally, then we wired our node to Aurora
Testnet RPC. We also configured a subgraph example and deployed that subgraph
on our local graph node. Finally the graph node was able to collect and index
the subgraph example (GravatarRegistry) events from Aurora Testnet.
