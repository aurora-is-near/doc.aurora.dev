# Welcome to Project Aurora

!!! caution "Here be dragons"

    This documentation is a work in progress and may contain incomplete,
    inaccurate, or outdated information.

**[Project Aurora] delivers an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on the [NEAR Protocol].**

## Introduction

Project Aurora provides the Eth 1.0 development experience, with layer 2-like speed and scalability.
If you are an Ethereum developer, getting starting on Aurora is as easy as changing the RPC endpoint you interact with.
If you're ready to dive in check out our [Develop] page for more information.

The capabilities of Aurora are possible because it is built on top of [NEAR].
NEAR is a modern layer 1 blockchain which is fast (2-3 second transaction finalization), scalable and [carbon neutral].
Even though NEAR is a separate blockchain from Ethereum, Aurora aims for full compatibility with Ethereum development tools such as [Truffle] and [Hardhat].
Additionally, NEAR's [trustless bridge] to Ethereum means even the assets on Aurora are the same as Ethereum.
For example, the base token on Aurora's EVM is the same Ether that exists on Ethereum itself.
