title: Add a token to Rainbow Bridge
---

If you are a developer, and you can deploy tokens using the Rainbow Bridge:

- Ethereum ERC-20 tokens can be deployed to NEAR and Aurora.
- NEAR NEP-141 tokens can be deployed to Aurora.

Following is the process:

1. Access the [Rainbow Bridge deployment](https://rainbowbridge.app/deploy) feature.
2. The UI will walk you through the deployment steps.
3. Once deployed, raise a pull request [on this repository](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/bridge-assets) to have the Aurora team add your metadata.
4. Once the Aurora team process and approve your PR, your token will be searchable by symbol on the
bridge transfer form and other dApps will be able to display balances correctly.

For questions, you can reach the bridge team at [bridge@aurora.dev](mailto:bridge@aurora.dev).
