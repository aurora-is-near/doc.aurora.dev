Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) support is currently available on the
following networks:

| Network             | Engine ID                  | Chain ID                | Endpoint URL                 |

:::note
Aurora runs on top of NEAR, meaning that the underlying NEAR gas is the real measure of
computational work. However, for compatibility with Ethereum we want our users to be able to pay for
transactions with ether (ETH). To enable this, the Aurora infrastructure includes relayers which
encapsulate ordinary EVM transactions into NEAR transactions, submit them on-chain, and return the
transaction result.

Transaction cost ~$0.02 (this value is not calculated automatically, just based on our
observations).
