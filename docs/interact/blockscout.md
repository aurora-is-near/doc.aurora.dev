While the Aurora Labs team works on the new Aurora block explorer - whose launch is expected to take place in the upcoming months (Q2'2023) — users will in the meantime be able to rely on our Blockscout-based interim solution to perform their usual tasks, located at [explorer.aurora.dev](https://explorer.aurora.dev/) for a Mainnet. There is an active development to deliver a Testnet instance of it soon.

Through Blockscout, users and developers can get access to the developer tools and network statistics that provide extended insights into Aurora's EVM.

Blockscout is one of the most well-known block explorers for Ethereum,
capable of delivering statistics, token transfers and lists, smart contract source code verification, and issuing read & write calls directly from the UI.
Users will be able to view transactions, addresses, and blocks.
Developers will also be able to see a wide range of charts and statistics related to smart contract execution, collator data, specific transfers between tokens, and a list of ERC-20 tokens on Aurora.
