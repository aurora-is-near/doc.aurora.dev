Black IDE is a multi-platform graphic IDE for smart contract development on Aurora, Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains.
It is one of the most powerful solidity IDE on the market
that has integrated some most popular toolkits in the Ethereum world, including Truffle, Hardhat, Waffle, Geth, web3.js/ethers.js, Etherscan API, and MetaMask.
Together with our self-built Keypair Manager and Contract Inspector,
Black IDE covers almost every step in the solidity smart contract development flow and runs on all major OS like Windows, macOS, Linux, and modern web browsers as well.
With built-in connections to Aurora mainnet and testnet, developers can now easily deploy smart contract projects to Aurora directly from Black IDE.
