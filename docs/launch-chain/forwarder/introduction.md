Centralized exchanges play a pivotal role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, offering a straightforward and accessible platform for users to trade cryptocurrencies.
These platforms are particularly valued for their user-friendly interfaces and the security they provide, making them the go-to option for both newcomers and seasoned traders.

Despite these benefits, CEXes have a notable limitation that impacts the user experience: they restrict the transfer of assets to blockchain networks not directly supported by the exchange.
Integrating CEX for such networks takes a lot of time and resources.

The consequence for app chains, subnets or similar, is the isolation from the liquidity provided by CEXes.

The Forwarder solves this issue by providing instant  CEX support for [Aurora Mainnet](/) and all [Aurora Chains](/launch-chain/introduction) from day one.

## How it works

The Forwarder automatically forwards any assets deposited on your Near deposit address to any Aurora address on any Aurora Chain, including Mainnet.

The result is the ability to withdraw assets from any exchange supporting Near Protocol, even if the exchange does not list the specific Aurora Chain as a withdrawal network.
