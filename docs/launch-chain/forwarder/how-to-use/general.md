1. Go to https://aurora.plus/forwarder and connect your wallet.
2. Click the “Generate my deposit address” button to create your Deposit Address. You might need to wait for a minute for it to be generated.
3. Go to the CEX of your choice and withdraw the funds to your Deposit Address. You can copy it from the Aurora+ website or scan the QR code with your camera in your CEX application.
 Make sure to select Near Protocol as the withdrawal network.
4. Once the withdrawal on CEX is finished, assets will be forwarded to your Aurora account automatically.

Here is a video guiding you through all of the steps above:

Your transfer will appear here once completed. Usually, the forwarding transfer takes just a few seconds. You need to take into account delays with the CEX withdrawals, which can sometimes take up to 10-15 minutes. See a more detailed answer [here](link to How fast will I receive my tokens? below).
