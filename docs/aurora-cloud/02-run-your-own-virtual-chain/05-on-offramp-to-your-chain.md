# On/offramp to your chain

Enabling the purchase of assets directly on your chain by your customers is crucial for their onboarding and for the best user experience.

But onramp services can be expensive, with steep setup costs (sometimes up to $100,000) and lengthy procedures.

**Aurora Cloud solves this problem by providing a universal on/offramp solution, compatible with any Aurora Virtual Chain, enabling the deposit of assets from day 1 on your chain.**

**How does it work?**

Since each Aurora Chain is a smart contract deployed on Near, they can seamlessly communicate with each other through the cross contract call technology (XCC).

This means that assets deposited on one chain can be transferred to another chain with a simple cross contract call.

In that context, when a user wants to onramp, assets are deposited first on Aurora Mainnet and then transferred to the relevant Virtual Chain.

The result is an onramp solution that does not require technical development on that particular Virtual Chain, can be deployed from day 1 and enables onramp of assets in seconds.

_Aurora partnered with Münzen to develop this solution._ [_Read more about Münzen_](https://munzen.io/ramp)
