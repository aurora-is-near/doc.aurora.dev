# Permissions API

Each Aurora Chain has two types of whitelists defining the level of permissions for end users:

1. _Transaction Access Whitelist:_ to enable user accounts (EOAs) to execute transactions on your chain.
2. _Deployment Access Whitelist:_ to enable EOAs to deploy contracts to your chain.

Both of them are optional. So, if you want to allow the usage and development for everyone, both of them will be disabled. If not, you will need to manage them.
