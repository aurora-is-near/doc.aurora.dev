# Manage permissions

Aurora Chains have three different profiles of permissions:

* **Public Chain**: Anyone can freely interact and deploy contracts on this chain.
* **Public Permissioned Chain:** The chain owner decides who can interact and deploy contracts on the chain. The transactions are still public and available on the Chain Explorer.
* **Private Chain**: A permissioned chain with fully private data. No one can see the transaction details on this chain. A private chain can be exported as a public one if requested.

Permissioned Chains use whitelists of wallet addresses or user IDs to determine who can interact with it and whoâ€™s authorised to deploy contracts. These lists are fully configurable via APIs and can be linked to any third party application. A common use case is to couple them with KYC/KYB to ensure only verified users interact with the chain.

The advantage of chain-level permission over contract-level permission is that once users are verified, they can freely interact with any services deployed on this chain, enabling the creation of fully compliant ecosystems.
