<summary>How are Virtual Chains different from L2s or L3s?</summary>

Virtual Chains are not separate chains such as L2s or L3s. They are deployed as smart contracts on an existing chain and inherit all of its security and scalability.&#x20;

This means that they do not require additional infrastructure and are extremely cost efficient.

Besides, they can natively communicate between each other, which means that they offer some customisation options while staying connected to the wider ecosystem.

<summary>Do I need an engineering team to run an Aurora Virtual Chain?</summary>

Absolutely not. The advantage of virtual chains is that they are using the existing infrastructure of the mother chain, in this case Near Protocol. This means that no maintenance is required from the owner of the Virtual Chain. \
Besides, the Aurora Cloud Console provides a simple interface to access most of the parameters of the Virtual Chain.

<summary>What assets can be bridged to an Aurora Virtual Chain?</summary>

As the Aurora Engine is running on Near Protocol, any asset on Near can be automatically bridged to an Aurora Chain.

Besides, ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum can be bridged directly to a virtual chain using the Rainbow Bridge.

A custom widget version of the rainbow bridge can be configured from the Aurora Cloud Console, enabling you to embed the bridge into your application directly.
