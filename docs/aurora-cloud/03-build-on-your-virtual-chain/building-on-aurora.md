# Building on Aurora

Each Aurora Virtual Chain is running the Aurora Engine, which means that deploying contracts and interacting with your Virtual Chain is identical to Aurora Mainnet. And since Aurora is EVM compatible, it is also identical to interacting with Ethereum, Polygon, Base, Arbitrum or any other EVM chain.

You can find more information about building dapps on Aurora in the Aurora documentation: [https://doc.aurora.dev/](https://doc.aurora.dev/)
