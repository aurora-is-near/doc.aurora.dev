# Welcome to Project Aurora

:::note

This documentation is a work in progress and may contain incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated information.

:::

**[Aurora] is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on the [NEAR Protocol]
blockchain, delivering a turn-key solution for developers to operate their
apps on an Ethereum-compatible, high-throughput, scalable, and future-safe
platform, with low transaction costs for their users.**

Aurora provides the Ethereum 1.0 development experience, with layer-2-like
speed and scalability. If you are an Ethereum developer, getting starting on
Aurora is as easy as changing the RPC endpoint you interact with. If you're
ready to dive in check out our [Develop] page for more information.

The capabilities of Aurora are possible because it is built on top of
[NEAR]. NEAR is a modern layer-1 blockchain which is fast (2-3 second
transaction finalization), scalable, and [carbon neutral].

Even though NEAR is a separate blockchain from Ethereum, Aurora aims for
full compatibility with Ethereum development tools such as [Truffle] and
[Hardhat]. Additionally, NEAR's [trustless bridge] to Ethereum means even
the assets on Aurora are the same as Ethereum. For example, account balances
in Aurora's EVM are denominated in the same Ether (ETH) as on Ethereum
itself.
