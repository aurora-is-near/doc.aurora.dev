# Intro

For bridging the origin chain of the token matters. It is not possible to mint a token on Aurora and move it to Ethereum.

Tokens that originated on Ethereum can be bridged to NEAR

Tokens that are presented on NEAR (originated ones and transferred from Ethereum) can be bridged to Aurora.

Tokens originated on Aurora cannot be bridged to NEAR.

Tokens originated on NEAR cannot be bridged to Ethereum.

So, if you want your token to trade on three networks, then deploy it on Ethereum, then bridge to NEAR,
then bridge to Aurora. Deploy → Approve → Bridge
