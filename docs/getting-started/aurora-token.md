title: "Aurora Token"
---

The [AuroraDAO](https://aurora.dev/dao) approved the creation of the official project governance token, $AURORA, with a total supply of 1 billion. The token was [deployed on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaaaaaa20d9e0e2461697782ef11675f668207961), 
and then bridged to NEAR and Aurora using the [Rainbow Bridge](https://rainbowbridge.app/). 
$AURORA was made available to the public during our [Initial DEX Offering](https://aurora.dev/ido) and distributed on our Token Generation Event (TGE) on November 18, 2021.

Below, we describe the $AURORA tokenomics, unlock schedule and use cases.

## Tokenomics

A portion of the tokens will be locked. The remainder of the tokens will be used in various initiatives to promote the NEAR and Ethereum ecosystems with the help of Aurora solutions.
### $AURORA Token Allocation

- **20% (200 million)**, unlocked, kept — Community Treasury
- **16% (160 million)**, locked, transferred — Aurora Labs long term incentives. Tokens also may be subjected to vesting scheme determined by Aurora Labs.
- **9% (90 million)**, locked, transferred — Aurora Labs private round investors. These tokens should be subjected to the unlocking scheme.
- **3% (30 million)**, unlocked, transferred — allocated to Aurora Labs to be distributed to NEAR ecosystem over the next three years. These tokens should be distributed linearly evenly to the delegators of Aurora validator. Aurora validator should switch to the following scheme of operations: fees should be equal to 30%, with 10% burned, and 20% used to fund the Rainbow Bridge operations and Aurora RPC.
- **2% (20 million)**, locked, transferred — early Aurora contributors. Allocations should be provided by NEAR Foundation. These tokens should be subjected to the unlocking scheme. NEAR Foundation may implement vesting scheme for these tokens.
- **1% (10 million)**, unlocked, transferred — allocated to Aurora Labs to be used as incentives for project advisors
- **1% (10 million)**, unlocked, transferred — allocated to Aurora Labs to be used for bootstrapping the Aurora ecosystem. These tokens should be used for IDO (public sale through one or multiple DEXes), deployment of pools on AMMs (to be matched by Aurora Labs own funds in stable coins or NEAR token), market making, early partnerships, and other activities determined by Aurora Labs. IDO parameters should be approved by the DAO.
- **48% (480 million)**, unlocked, kept — kept on the DAO balance for future projects.

## Token unlock schedule

The unlocking schedule for locked tokens is the following, relative to the TGE event on November 18, 2021:
-Two-year unlocking schedule
- Linear-vesting with unlock events every 3 months
- 6 month cliff, starting November 18, 2021 (25% unlocked after 6 months, then additional 12.5% after 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months).

## Use cases

$AURORA is a governance token, with a portion of the token is allocated to the Community Treasury. The primary use of the treasury will be to fund existing and proposed projects, through a "Kickstarter" type platform in which token holders will vote on submitted proposals. The details around the platform will be decided by the AuroraDAO.

The AuroraDAO will consider other use cases, including but not limited to:
- $AURORA token staking
- Incentives for token holders to take part in voting with the allocation of $AURORA from the Community Treasury
- Rainbow Bridge transfer finalization fees
- Rainbow bridge fast transfers fees
- Aurora contract additional execution fees
- Aurora validator private transaction pool service
- Farming of locked funds in the Rainbow Bridge connectors
