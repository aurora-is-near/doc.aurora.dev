### I have send my tokens to a wrong wallet - can I recover them?

Aurora Pass does not currently support other EVM chains and L2s, except Aurora and Aurora Chains.
Sometimes by mistake a user can send assets to her address on those non-supported networks instead.

E.g, suppose you have send your assets to some of yours Ethereum addresses.

Then, if you have a private key of that address or a seed phrase - these tokens can be easily recovered by importing one of them into a compatible wallet like MetaMask and
 then bridging them to Aurora or to any other address.

In a case if you have transferred them to CEX address, you won't be able to recover these tokens, if that CEX doesn't support Aurora yet. Currently, we support Coinbase, KuCoin and Gate.io CEXes.

### I can't find the token [XYZ] in my wallet â€“ can I add it somehow?

### I have paid for my transaction pack, but got no transactions added

Please, contact our [Support Team](https://discord.gg/dEFJBz8HQV), we will help you to get your transaction pack.

### I can't see my balances in Aurora Pass

Sometimes such situation could happen because of some local restrictions in your country of residence. Please, try using another internet connection or VPN to solve the issue.

### I get 'Pairing failed: Pairing already exists' error while connecting to a DApp

This error looks like this:
![ap_pairing_error.png](/img/ap_pairing_error.png)

This error means that DApp is already using some existing pairing but the wallet doesn't know it was disconnected, so there is some non-sync state between them.

To fix it, please try to follow the next steps:

1. Try to disconnect all previously connected wallets from that DApp.
2. Re-connect with you AuroraPass wallet to a DApp.

In a case the problem persists, please contact our [Support Team](https://discord.gg/dEFJBz8HQV).

### I see symbols like 0xab4... during signing a DApp transaction in Aurora Pass - what do they mean?

If you are a user, please contact either DApp support team or [Aurora Support Team](https://discord.gg/dEFJBz8HQV) and ask them to verify the contracts used in that DApp.

If you are a developer, make sure to verify your DApp contracts in [Aurora Explorer](https://explorer.aurora.dev/).
This will make sure that a user sees nicely formatted information - function name and its arguments' names while using the Aurora Pass wallet.

In a case of having non-verified contract a user will see non-decoded function name and arguments, which will look uncomprehensible and non-clear.

So, we advice you to verify all (or most) of your contracts, which gives your users better understanding of their interactions with your product via Aurora Pass.

### I have a problem, which is not on the list

Please, contact our [Support Team](https://discord.gg/dEFJBz8HQV) on Discord and open a ticket describing your problem.
