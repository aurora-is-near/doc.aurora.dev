# Promo Widget

If you develop a DApp, you will need a way to get your users to install the Aurora Pass application on their phones. We have created a widget to simplify this step.
This modal leads a user to download the wallet application for iOS or Android by scanning a QR code:

![ap_widget_qr_and_main](/img/ap_widget_qr_and_main.png)

Users can always say they already have the wallet installed, and this popup won't be shown for them next time.

## Quick integration guide

1. Load a script from this [link](https://pass.auroracloud.dev/promo.js), and import it to your project.
2. This adds a function to the `window` object called `openPromo`.
3. To open the widget, call `window.openPromo` and pass the `onComplete` function as a parameter `window.openPromo({ onComplete: function })`
4. You can also check if the function is available before calling it `window.openPromo ? window.openPromo({ onComplete: function }) : function()`
5. Optionally, you can hide the _Update your app_ header by passing the `hideUpdateAppBlock` variable via the `config` argument:
 `window.openPromo({ onComplete: () => {...}, config: {hideUpdateAppBlock: true}})`

You can also find the same instructions [here](https://pass.auroracloud.dev/).
A more detailed example of integration is below.

## Detailed integration guide

In the case of building a React app, you can add the `promo.js` script to it by using the `useEffect` hook like this:

```jsx title="aurora-pass-example/src/App.js"
...
import { useEffect } from "react";

let scriptAdded = false;

function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    if(!scriptAdded) {
      const script = document.createElement("script");
      script.src = "https://pass.auroracloud.dev/promo.js";
      script.async = true;
      document.body.appendChild(script);
    }
  }, []);

 ...
}
```

:::note
We assume the project we're working on here is a default `create-react-app` application to simplify things. You can read more about it [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/).
:::

Then, let's add a function `openModal` to display our Promo Widget just after the imports somewhere:

```jsx title="aurora-pass-example/src/App.js"
...
const openWeb3Modal = () => {
  alert("Just a placeholder for now. We will add Web3Modal here later.")
};

const openWidget = () => {
  window.openPromo
    ? window.openPromo({ onComplete: openWeb3Modal, config: {hideUpdateAppBlock: true} })
    : openWeb3Modal()
}
...
```

Now, we can set the `onClick` attribute of one of our UI components to display the modal. We can re-use the already existing `App-link` element to use the `openWidget` function:

```jsx title="aurora-pass-example/src/App.js"

function App() {
  ...

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        ...
        <a
          className="App-link"
          href="#"
          onClick={openWidget}
        >
          Open Promo
        </a>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}
```

If you click on the `Open Promo` link, you will be able to see the Promo Widget now:
![ap_widget_example_1](/img/ap_widget_example_1.png)

And then, if you click further on the 'Skip, I have a wallet' button, you will see the placeholder message about Web3Modal:
![ap_widget_example_1](/img/ap_widget_example_2.png)

You can also look at the more extensive [integration example here](/onboard/wallets/web3modal#integrate-web3modal) to learn how to add Web3Modal to your project,
 particular section describing it is [here](/onboard/wallets/web3modal#add-web3modal).

### What should be called in the `onComplete` function?

The widget calls any function you pass to it. So you could pass anything to it, whether thatâ€™s opening Web3Modal or RainbowKit popups or any other function.
But it works best and is meant to be used with WebModal v3 since the modal is styled similarly.
