title: Block Explorer
---
While the Aurora Labs team works on the new Aurora block explorer - whose launch is expected to take place in the upcoming months (Q2'2023) â€” users will in the meantime be able to rely on our Blockscout-based interim solution to perform their usual tasks, located at [explorer.aurora.dev](https://explorer.aurora.dev/) for a Mainnet. Testnet one is located at [explorer.testnet.aurora.dev.](https://explorer.testnet.aurora.dev/)

By using Block Explorer, users and developers can get access to the developer tools and network statistics that provide extended insights into Aurora's EVM.

Blockscout is one of the most well-known block explorers for Ethereum, capable of delivering statistics, token transfers and lists, smart contract source code verification, and issuing read & write calls directly from the UI.

Users are able to view transactions, addresses, and blocks. Developers can get a wide range of charts and statistics related to smart contract execution, collator data, specific transfers between tokens, and a list of [ERC-20 tokens on Aurora](https://explorer.mainnet.aurora.dev/tokens).\
\
You can also see all of the verified contracts[here](https://explorer.mainnet.aurora.dev/verified-contracts), work with [API](https://explorer.mainnet.aurora.dev/api-docs) or [use GraphQL](https://explorer.mainnet.aurora.dev/graphiql) to query information about blocks or transactions.\
\
As an example of the API usage, you can get your ERC-20 token balance by using this method:

Or get source code or ABI for the verified contract by calling those ones:
