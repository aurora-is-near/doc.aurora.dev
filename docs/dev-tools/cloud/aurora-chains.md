### What are Aurora Chains?

Aurora Chains are dedicated EVM-compatible blockchains built on top of the Near Protocol. It is your own instance of Aurora – every Aurora Chain is based upon the [Aurora smart contract,](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine/) also called [Aurora Engine](https://doc.aurora.dev/getting-started/aurora-engine).

### What is Aurora Engine?

Aurora Engine is an [Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)](https://doc.aurora.dev/evm/evm-overview) built on the [Near Protocol](https://medium.com/dia-insights/hello-near-protocol-dia-oracles-now-available-natively-on-near-3bbef5b3f13), that provides a solution for developers to deploy their apps on an Ethereum-compatible, high-throughput, scalable, and secure platform, with low transaction costs and fast finality for their users.

### Aurora Chains Support

We're sharing years of our expertise and technology by making available Aurora Chains to the public. Aurora Chain can be configured to be aligned in the best way with your business model and goals. The [Aurora Labs](https://auroralabs.dev/) team will help you to set up, maintain and support your chain.

### What can be configured?

To make Aurora Chain work in the best way possible for your business, we will help you to configure your setup. Among the features to configure are:

* ***custom token & fee mechanics*** (e.g., gasless transactions; paying for gas with a custom token; some percentage of any transaction value to be stored in Aurora Chain Treasury, etc.);
* ***custom access control*** (public vs private chain, who can transact, who can deploy contracts? e.g., NFT-based access to the blockchain, the private chain can be built by using a private Near shard – [Calimero](https://www.calimero.network/)).

### Aurora Chains Advantages

What makes Aurora Chains stand out is a set of top-notch technical solutions done on the level of blockchain architecture, ecosystem, and infrastructure:

* ***seamless interoperability*** with Aurora, Near, and any other Aurora Chains: you can freely move your assets using Rainbow Bridge, call contracts via cross-contract calls, etc.; This is the main difference between Aurora Chains and other solutions (like Avalanche or Cosmos). There is no disjointness in between. You can call any smart contract in any other Aurora Chain or Near and interact with it freely.
* ***tremendous transaction throughput*** – we can provide you with dozens of millions of transactions daily for your ecosystem.
