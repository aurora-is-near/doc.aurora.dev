[Covalent](https://www.covalenthq.com/?utm_source=aurora\&utm_medium=partner-docs) is a hosted blockchain data solution providing access to historical and current on-chain data for [100+ supported blockchains](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/?utm_source=aurora\&utm_medium=partner-docs), including [Aurora](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/aurora/?utm_source=aurora\&utm_medium=partner-docs).

Covalent maintains a full archival copy of every supported blockchain, meaning every balance, transaction, log event, and NFT asset data is available from the genesis block. This data is available via:

1. [Unified API](https://dillinger.io/#unified-api) - Incorporate blockchain data into your app with a familiar REST API
2. [Increment](https://dillinger.io/#increment) - Create and embed custom charts with no-code analytics

**Use Covalent if you need:**

* Structured and enhanced on-chain data well beyond what you get from RPC providers
* Broad and deep multi-chain data at scale
* Enterprise-grade performance

### API Tiers

### Free tier

The Covalent Unified API has been and always will be free.

All accounts on the Covalent API Free tier will be allocated 100,000 free credits per month. Credits on the free tier are spent across all endpoints and networks (including testnets). Once this free allocation is consumed, calls to the API from that account will be paused.

The Free tier is meant for trying the Covalent API, especially for early-stage projects and hackathon builders.

**Key Features:**

* 4 RPS
* 100,000 credits per month, spent across all endpoints and networks (including testnets)

### Premium Tier

The Premium tier is available for users who want to scale with us and require better performance for their applications. Users can access Premium endpoints that are production ready with better reliability and faster response times.

**Key Features:**

* 50 RPS
* 100,000 credits per month, spent across all endpoints and networks (including testnets)
* Auto-scaling Flex credits allow your app to consume credits past the included 100,000 credits
* 10x faster average response time
* 50% decrease in response time variance

## Increment

![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/95026/1688042855-1684974544-increment-example-partner-docs.png)

Increment is a novel no-code charting and reporting tool powered by Covalent, revolutionizing how the Web3 space approaches analytics. Many analytics tools let you write SQL to create charts, but *Increment is the only one to encode business logic - Reach, Retention, and Revenue - into an SQL compiler that can write valid SQL for you.*

### Use cases

Increment can be used for:

* [Analyzing Blockchain Networks](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/increment/data-models/chain-gdp/?utm_source=aurora\&utm_medium=partner-docs)
* [Analyzing DEXs](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/increment/data-models/swap-land/?utm_source=aurora\&utm_medium=partner-docs)
* [Analyzing NFT Marketplaces](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/increment/data-models/jpeg-analysis/?utm_source=aurora\&utm_medium=partner-docs)

For example, [click here](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/aurora/?utm_source=aurora\&utm_medium=partner-docs#network-status) to get the latest number of active wallets, transactions, and tokens by day, week, month, or year for Aurora:
