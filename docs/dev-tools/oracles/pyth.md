Pyth Network is an oracle that publishes financial market data to multiple blockchains. Our market data is contributed by over 80 [first-party publishers(opens in a new tab)](https://pyth.network/publishers/), including some of the biggest exchanges and market-making firms in the world. We offer price feeds for a number of different asset classes, including [US equities, commodities, and cryptocurrencies(opens in a new tab)](https://pyth.network/price-feeds/). Each price feed publishes a [robust aggregate](https://docs.pyth.network/documentation/how-pyth-works/price-aggregation) of publisher prices that updates multiple times per second.

### Price Feeds

Price feeds are available on multiple blockchains and can also be used in off-chain applications. Pyth offers three different data products to support various applications:

* [Solana Price Feeds](https://docs.pyth.network/documentation/solana-price-feeds) provide real-time prices on Solana mainnet.
* [Pythnet Price Feeds](https://docs.pyth.network/documentation/pythnet-price-feeds) provide real-time prices for 20+ blockchain ecosystems. They are available in mainnet for most [EVM chains](https://docs.pyth.network/documentation/pythnet-price-feeds/evm) – including Ethereum, BNB, Avalanche, and more – several [Cosmos chains](https://docs.pyth.network/documentation/pythnet-price-feeds/cosmwasm), [Aptos](https://docs.pyth.network/documentation/pythnet-price-feeds/aptos), and [Sui](https://docs.pyth.network/documentation/pythnet-price-feeds/sui). More ecosystems are coming soon!
* [Benchmarks](https://docs.pyth.network/documentation/benchmarks) provides historical Pyth prices for both on- and off-chain use. These historical prices can be used for settlement or other similar applications.

Application developers can follow the links above to learn more about how to consume data from each product.
