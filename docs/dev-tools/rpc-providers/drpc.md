## How it works?

NodeCloud provides developers with fast, reliable, and globally distributed RPC access by routing requests across a decentralized pool of independent node operators. Instead of relying on a single centralized vendor, NodeCloud intelligently distributes traffic across 40+ providers to ensure maximum uptime, low latency, and high performance for Web3 applications.

At the core of NodeCloud’s infrastructure is an AI-powered global load-balancing system that evaluates provider performance in real time. Each request is automatically routed to the fastest, healthiest node available — ensuring consistent RPC quality even under heavy traffic or regional outages.

NodeCloud also includes a set of developer tools and observability features that simplify integration, improve debugging, and allow teams to scale their dApps without worrying about infrastructure bottlenecks.

### Distributed Network of Independent Data Providers

NodeCloud’s provider pool consists of independent companies and node operators who run high-performance blockchain infrastructure. These providers are distributed across nine global geoclusters, ensuring that users worldwide can access low-latency RPC endpoints.

Each provider maintains its own optimized node stack for networks such as Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, Avalanche, and more. Providers are evaluated continuously for:
	•	Latency
	•	Uptime
	•	Consistency of responses
	•	Node synchronization
	•	Throughput capacity

NodeCloud’s system intelligently weights providers based on their real-time performance so that requests flow only through operators that meet strict reliability requirements.
