title: 	ERC-721 NFT Token
---

In this article, we will consider an ERC-721 NFT contract example. You will learn how to deploy and interact with it.

:::note

In case you are not familiar with a standard we advise you to read more about it on the OpenZeppelin website:
[ERC-721 article](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/erc721) and [ERC-20 API](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/token/erc721).

Here is the full contract code below:

contract CovidVaccineToken is ERC721URIStorage {
    uint256 private _tokensCount = 0;
    address public minter = address(0);

    modifier onlyMinter(){
        require(
            minter == msg.sender,
            'Invalid Minter'
        );

        minter = msg.sender;
    }

    function mint(address to) external onlyMinter {
        uint256 tokenId = _tokensCount + 1;
        _mint(to, tokenId);
        _tokensCount = tokenId;
    }

    function burn(uint256 tokenId) external {
        _burn(tokenId);
        _tokensCount -= 1;
    }

    function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) public virtual override {
        require(minter == msg.sender || to == minter, 'Invalid Transfer');
        safeTransferFrom(from, to, tokenId, "");
    }

    function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes memory _data) public virtual override {
        require(minter == msg.sender || to == minter, 'Invalid Transfer');
        require(_isApprovedOrOwner(_msgSender(), tokenId), "ERC721: transfer caller is not owner nor approved");
        _safeTransfer(from, to, tokenId, _data);
    }
}
```

You can find [a GitHub repo](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-examples/blob/main/truffle/erc721-example/)
 and [another version of this tutorial](https://dev.aurora.dev/ecosystem/truffle) on Aurora Developer Portal.
:::

This example is originally forked from the [OpenZeppelin
examples](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc721). However, the code
has been changed to fit the use case of this tutorial. The use case is about how
to deploy and manage the life cycle of a simple COVID-19 vaccine NFT token ðŸ’Š
using Truffle on the Aurora Testnet.

## Vaccine NFT Token Lifecycle

On the image below you can observe how a lifecycle of the Vaccine NFT token looks like:

![Truffle NFT example](/img/truffle_nft_example.png)

Let's describe it step by step:

1. The minter address (which is managed by the vaccination program manager) can
distribute (mint) the vaccine tickets (NFT tokens ðŸ’Š) to the people who are
part of the vaccination program.

2. When participants receive the tokens ðŸ’Š, they can get access to the vaccine
by spending the NFT token.

3. This means either burning the NFT token or sending it back to the minter
address.

4. If the participant chooses to send it back then the minter can redistribute
that token to the other participant in the line.

5. Then the new participant will have access to the same vaccine token that has
been used by the previous participant.

## Create project

To create a project, clone the examples repository, go to `erc-721-example` folder, and install `yarn` dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-examples.git
cd aurora-examples/truffle/erc721-example/
yarn install
```

## Configure project

Add your Mnemonic (from MetaMask or other Web3 wallet) to the environment variable:

```bash
 export MNEMONIC='YOUR MNEMONIC HERE'
```

Now in `truffle-config.js`, you will need to change the `from` address as shown
below in the `aurora` network section:

```json
...
aurora: {
  provider: () => setupWallet('https://testnet.aurora.dev'),
  network_id: 0x4e454153,
  gas: 10000000,
  from: 0x6A33382de9f73B846878a57500d055B981229ac4 // change this to your address here
},
```

The `truffle-config.js` configuration will pick up your `MNEMONIC` environment
variable and recover the address that will be used for sending and signing
transactions on the Aurora network.

## Deploy contract

:::note
To use the commands below you will need Node.js and `yarn` to be installed. Please follow the [instructions here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) to install Node.js.
Then, install `yarn` with `npm install --global yarn` or read more [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).
:::

To deploy the `CovidVaccineToken` contract, you can run the `yarn` command as
follows:

```bash
yarn deploy:aurora
....
_deploy_contracts.js

## Playing with the Truffle Console

Now you can test the flow as mentioned in the [NFT Example](#nft-example)
section:

### Mint tokens

The minter mints and transfers NFT tokens for the vaccine program participant.
In this example, the new participant address is
`accounts[1]` and the minter address is `accounts[0]`.

Please make sure that you are using the same deployer address as a minter
address, otherwise the `mint` transaction will revert.

```bash
% truffle console --network aurora
truffle(aurora)> const cvt = await CovidVaccineToken.deployed()
truffle(aurora)> const minter = accounts[0]
truffle(aurora)> const participant = accounts[1]
truffle(aurora)> await cvt.minter() == minter
true
truffle(aurora)> await cvt.mint(participant, {from: minter})
```

You should notice that none of the participants are allowed to transfer their
NFT tokens to anyone except back to the minter.

So let's try to use any participant address to validate this. To do that, change
the value of `from` to `accounts[1]`, so that the sender will be the first
participant (e.g., the participant address
`0x2531a4D108619a20ACeE88C4354a50e9aC48ecfe`).

In the Truffle console:

```bash
truffle(aurora)> await cvt.safeTransferFrom(participant, accounts[2], 1, {from: participant})
Uncaught Error: execution reverted:
...
reason: 'Invalid Transfer',
  hijackedStack: 'Error: execution reverted:\n'
```

This is exactly the same error message we have in our NFT contract in
`safeTransferFrom`:

```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(
    address from, 
    address to, 
    uint256 tokenId
) 
    public 
    virtual 
    override 
    {
        require(
            minter == msg.sender || to == minter,
            'Invalid Transfer'
        );
        safeTransferFrom(from, to, tokenId, "");
    }
```

### Transfer tokens

Participants can transfer the token to the minter after receiving the vaccine.
As shown below, a participant can only send the NFT token if the receiver for
this token is the minter (`accounts[0]`).

```bash
truffle(aurora)> const tokenID = 1
truffle(aurora)> await cvt.ownerOf(tokenID) == participant
true
truffle(aurora)> await cvt.safeTransferFrom(participant, minter, tokenID, {from: participant})
truffle(aurora)> await cvt.ownerOf(tokenID) == minter
true
```

### Burn tokens

This is an alternative scenario for the NFT token lifecycle. Instead of
transferring the token back to the minter, the participant can decide to burn the
NFT token by calling the `burn` function:

```bash
truffle(aurora)> await cvt.burn(1, {from: participant}) // 1 is the tokenID
```

### Redistribute tokens

Finally, the minter can send the same token (if not burnt) to a new participant
in the line:

```bash
truffle(aurora)> await cvt.safeTransferFrom(minter, accounts[2], 1, {from: minter})
truffle(aurora)> await cvt.ownerOf(1) == accounts[2]
true
```

## Summary

In this simple tutorial, we deployed an NFT contract to the Aurora Testnet using
Truffle and interacted with the contract's functions.
