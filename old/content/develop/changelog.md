## 2021-05-24

### All endpoints

- **Aurora Relayer**: Fixed a bug in the `eth_call` RPC method. This had been
  affecting MetaMask users in particular.
  ([1d0d7cd](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-relayer/commit/1d0d7cd7f00da1f0d118e8a79cfc70362ed773f2))

## 2021-05-19

- We have rolled out [new endpoint URLs](/develop/networks.html). Changing
  from the former endpoint URL `https://rpc.$NETWORK.aurora.dev:8545` to
  `https://$NETWORK.aurora.dev` is recommended and will decrease your
  response latency and increase your rate limits.

  `eth_getTransactionReceipt` RPC method which was causing Truffle to
  believe that the transaction reverted when deploying contracts.

- Fixed the [CORS preflight](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Preflight_request)
  response by ensuring that the response has status code 204 and contains
  the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` and `Access-Control-Allow-Methods:
  OPTIONS, POST` headers.
